My name is Yvo Trimbos. As a school boy, I found out quite quickly, thatI was mostly interested in technical courses like mathematics, physics and chemistry. After having done VWO (pre-university education), I started to study Chemical Engineering at the HTS in Breda (higher vocational education). Having finished this study, I continued at the Technical University in Eindhoven, where I received my Master's diploma as Chemical Engineer in 1995 (MSChE).

My first job in the "PU- Business" was as a laboratory employee in a company making (mainly) OCF products (One Component Foam = canister PU-foam). Before I started in the laboratory, I worked in the production, making polyol blends and unloading tank trucks (pMDI, polyols, flame retardants, propellants et cetera). After this "introduction"-period, I started in the laboratory, where I got to know people that taught me the basics of OCF.

Having worked there for 3 years, I continued my career as R&D Manager at an aerosol-company in Bavaria (Germany). OCF and technical aerosols were produced there. Next to managing the lab, main task was improve product quality and develop new products for OCF. In that period, the product quality was noticeably improved, the product range grew from 4 to 23 types and the production amounts increased >7x. The company became a serious European top 5 OCF producer.

After having worked in Germany for almost 7 years, I was contracted by a company in The Netherlands making PU rigid block foam (PUR and PIR) and 2-component PU systems. This relatively small family owned Dutch enterprise recruited me as R&D Manager to (re)organize the lab and to get more out of R&D and QC. From a chemical and technological point of view, this company gave me a lot of pleasure working with all kinds of polyols, stabilizers, catalysts, flame retardants et cetera. Also the technical support the customers needed and the legislative and normative needs, were a real challenge for me to deal with and gave me a lot of joy and knowledge.

After > 4,5 years, I was head hunted for a job as Head of R&D for a large multinational in sealing products (sealants on base of silicone,acrylics, MS-Polymer, PU and SPUR and OCF foams). This newly created job resulted from a re-organization going to more centralization for R&D-work, with the ultimate goal to have one central R&D centre. After having worked there for one year, the company changed its view 180 degrees: new goal was decentralization. This made me leave the company and decide to start on my own as independent PU Consultant. With >15 years of experience in the PU-industry, I am sure I can help companies with PU-related issues, whether it has to do with chemistry, technology, legislation, laboratory management, et cetera.
