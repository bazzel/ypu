##YPU (Why PolyUrethane)?

Because polyurethane (chemistry) is fascinating and the use of all kinds of polyurethanes is extremely versatile. They can be found everywhere in our daily life and give us comfort, strength and energy saving in a cheap, safe, durable and environmentally responsible way.

Polyurethanes can be found in a diversity of industries/applications as building & construction, automotive, furniture & bedding, appliances, packaging, footwear, electronics, medical, et cetera. One way to group PU can be as follows:

+ *Rigid foams*
Commonly used as insulation for buildings, refrigerators, freezers, reefer containers. PU rigid insulation foam gives the best (commercially available) insulation value per unit thickness. Higher densities are also used for simulated wood products and as structural foams (rigid foamshave very good structural strength related to weight).
+ *Flexible foams*
Mostly used for for mattresses, seats and cushions. But also as part of footwear soles, sound damping mats, wound care dressings.
+ *Solid polyurethanes*
For print rollers, casting/potting, coatings, adhesives, sealants and thermoplastic elastomers (TPUs),  medical devices, textiles.

With the availability of a huge amount of different chemicals with which PU products can be made, the variations for the end product are endless. Products can be tailor made through choosing the right raw materials, conditions and process. This determines the properties of the product: high or low density, mechanical strength, fire classification, chemical resistency, colour, UV-stability, et cetera.

Having all this freedom to create PU products, also makes it complex. And having knowledge and experience of chemicals and chemistry is not enough. The right way to formulate, to evaluate, to understand the needs of customers and norms/standards/legislation and to know possibilities to test are of great importance too.
