# YPU (Why PolyUrethane)?

Because polyurethane (chemistry) is fascinating and the use of all kindsof polyurethanes is extremely versatile. They can be found everywhere inour daily life and give us comfort, strength and energy saving in acheap, safe, durable and environmentally responsible way.

Polyurethanes can be found in a diversity of industries/applications asbuilding & construction, automotive, furniture & bedding, appliances,packaging, footwear, electronics, medical, et cetera. One way to groupPU can be as follows:

+ *Rigid foams*
Commonly used as insulation for buildings, refrigerators, freezers,reefer containers. PU rigid insulation foam gives the best (commerciallyavailable) insulation value per unit thickness.Higher densities are alsoused for simulated wood products and as structural foams (rigid foamshave very good structural strength related to weight).
+ *Flexible foams*
Mostly used for for mattresses, seats and cushions. But also as part offootwear soles, sound damping mats, wound care dressings.
+ *Solid polyurethanes*
For print rollers, casting/potting, coatings, adhesives, sealants andthermoplastic elastomers (TPUs),  medical devices, textiles

With the availability of a huge amount of different chemicals with whichPU products can be made, the variations for the end product are endless.Products can be tailor made through choosing the right raw materials,conditions and process. This determines the properties of the product:high or low density, mechanical strength, fire classification, chemicalresistency, colour, UV-stability, et cetera.

Having all this freedom to create PU products, also makes it complex.And having knowledge and experience of chemicals and chemistry is notenough. The right way to formulate, to evaluate, to understand the needsof customers and norms/standards/legislation and to know possibilitiesto test are of great importance too.

YPU Consulting can help through advising, informing, supporting,educating and training!
